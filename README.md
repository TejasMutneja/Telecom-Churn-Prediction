Customer Churn Prediction Project

Objective

Customer churn is a critical problem for businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on various features related to their account and service usage.
We utilize machine learning models to analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle and determine the key factors influencing churn. The ultimate goal is to help businesses take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer-related information such as:
Demographics: Gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents
Service usage: Internet service type, online security, streaming services, etc.
Account details: Contract type, payment method, tenure, monthly charges
Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)
The dataset undergoes preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to identify the best churn prediction model.

Project Workflow
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
   
Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and an initial exploration is performed.
Missing values are identified and handled using KNN Imputation to ensure data completeness.
Removing Unnecessary Columns
Columns that do not contribute to predictions, such as CustomerID, Churn Label, and Churn Reason, are removed.
Encoding Categorical Features
Categorical variables such as Gender, Contract Type, and Payment Method are converted into numerical format using Label Encoding.
Handling Class Imbalance
Since churned customers are usually fewer, the dataset is balanced using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to prevent bias in predictions.

2. Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction
   
Feature Selection using SelectKBest
We apply SelectKBest (ANOVA F-Test) to identify the most significant features for predicting churn.
Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the number of features while retaining essential information. This improves model efficiency and avoids overfitting.

3. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
   
We train multiple machine learning models to compare their performance:
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
 Decision Tree Classifier
 Random Forest Classifier
 Gradient Boosting Classifier
 XGBoost Classifier
 Hyperparameter Optimization using GridSearchCV
Each model undergoes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters that maximize accuracy.

4. Model Evaluation
   
Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:
   Accuracy Score – Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
   Classification Report – Provides Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
   Confusion Matrix – Visualizes correct vs. incorrect classifications.
   Cross-Validation – Ensures the model performs well across different data splits.

5. Model Comparison & Insights
   
Analyzing Performance Differences
The models are compared based on their performance metrics.
We analyze why some models perform better than others based on dataset characteristics.
Business Interpretation
The most influential features leading to churn are identified.
Strategies are suggested for customer retention, such as offering discounts to high-risk customers.

Key Insights

High Impact Features: Contract type, monthly charges, and additional services (e.g., online security) are among the strongest predictors of churn.
Customer Segmentation: The model effectively identifies high-risk customer segments, allowing for targeted retention efforts.
Robust Performance: Ensemble methods consistently outperform simpler models, highlighting the complex interactions within the data.


Final Thoughts

This project provides a data-driven approach to churn prediction, helping businesses retain customers effectively. By understanding the factors influencing churn, companies can take preventive actions to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
